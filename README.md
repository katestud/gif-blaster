# Gif Blaster

## Background

I write a good amount of GitHub Team Discussions. I also like to include gifs in
these discussions! But sometimes, gifs are distracting. It'd be nice to be able
to remove them all so you can focus on the text / static content of a discussion.

This extension helps facilitate that by adding a button to Team Discussions that,
on click, removes all gifs on the page.

More coming soon. :)
